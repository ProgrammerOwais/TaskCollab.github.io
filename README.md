# TaskCollab Web App: For Project & Task Collaboration with Team

Welcome to TaskCollab, your ultimate solution for seamless task
tracking, collaboration, and team management! TaskCollab is a powerful
web application designed to streamline your team's workflow, allowing
you to conquer even the most ambitious projects with ease.

## Features

### AUTHENTICATION & AUTHORIZATION

Authentication: Ensures that users are who they claim to be. It involves verifying the identity of users before granting access to the application. Users are required to log in with valid Google.

Authorization: Determines what actions and resources a user is allowed to access within the application. After authentication, the application checks the user's permissions and role-based access ( user, member, admin) to ensure they can perform specific actions or view certain data.

### Projects, Joined & Collaboration Section

In this web app we have different pages.
Projects: only dislpay your projects.
Joined: only display those projects which you joined.
Collaboration: Others Projects which you havn't joined.

### The Main Feature Project

The main theme of this app is to create projects & invite users or your team members to collaboratively work on it.

The projects is of two types
Open Source: Anyone can join & work on it.
Private: Only invited Users can Join & work on it.

In the Project Detail we have
Projcet name,
Project Detail,
Project Types: open source / private
Team Members
Tasks: task name, descrption, starting date, ending date.
Chat Section: can message to your members & talk to each other.

### Role Base System:

The projects of this app is role based, only admin can update the projects, delete the tasks or even delete the project, users & members don't have the permission to delete or update the projects.

Members have the ability to start the task, complete the task & gives the updates about the task in chat section.

If you are not a member, you can't chat in there & can't have the ability to start any task.

If you are not loggedIn, it means you are not a user, so you will be unable to see the projects data & main data.

## Dynamicity

This app is fully dynamic, every changes you will make in any page, section of app, it will directly make changes to others section of app where it is connected.

Users have the ability to check others user profile & it is fully dynamic, if a user created a project & you are interested of this user projects then you can easily check its profile by clicking on its logo & it will lead you to the profile page, where you can directly message him & checks his entire history, his projects & collaboration with other teams.

Remember its a fully dynamic, every user who created the project, you can go to its profile & check his history, even can make a connection with him.

## High Speed & Fully Optimized

The logic & algorithm which I used in this app, makes it to work very fast & everything is optimized. I used the "useContext" which will temporary store the backend data & when you will work with projects, it will not bore you to wait, but at the backend the process is working on its own flow.

Means while working in projects, it will connect to the APIs end points & will make the changes as normal APIs do & take times but it will not feel you like you are waiting it will work very fast bcz the data you will be working will be "useContext" which will makes it very fast & also tracks the backend data history too.
